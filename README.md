## Introduction

The Python AI Chess Game is an implementation of the classic chess game that incorporates AI algorithms to enable intelligent moves and gameplay. This game allows players to play against the computer, which utilizes AI techniques to make strategic decisions and provide a challenging experience.

## Game Rules

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares. Each player controls a set of 16 pieces, including pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, a queen, and a king. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is in a position to be captured (in "check") and there is no legal move to remove the threat.

## Features

The Python AI Chess Game offers the following features:

- Move Validation: Validates moves according to the rules of chess.
- Undo Move: Allows players to undo their moves.
- Game Over Detection: Detects checkmate, stalemate, and draw scenarios.
- Intelligent AI: Implements various AI algorithms for the computer player's moves.

## Algorithms Used

This chess game employs the following algorithms:

1. Best-First Search: Used to explore the game tree and determine the best move based on a heuristic evaluation function.
2. Minimax Search: Enables the computer player to analyze future moves by recursively evaluating the board positions and selecting the best move.
3. Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes the Minimax algorithm by pruning unnecessary branches of the game tree, reducing the number of evaluations required.

These algorithms work together to provide the computer player with intelligent decision-making capabilities.

## Usage

- Make moves by entering the starting and ending positions of the chess pieces using the standard algebraic notation (e.g., "e2 e4").
- The computer player will make its moves based on the selected AI algorithms.
- Continue playing until the game is completed, and the winner is determined.
